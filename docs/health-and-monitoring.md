# Health & monitoring

`graft arborist --tend` is graft's **self-monitoring loop** — a continuous tending pass
that watches a running fleet and reports what's wrong. It is **detection-first**: it
observes, classifies, and ships findings to wherever you want them. It does **not**
remediate anything (yet) — see [the self-healing seam](#the-self-healing-seam).

The one-shot `graft arborist` verifies the GitHub App auth chain once and exits.
`--tend` keeps the doctor in the room: it runs the auth check *plus* four more detectors
on a cadence, forever.

```sh
graft arborist --tend                 # tend the active profile, default 60s sweeps
graft arborist --tend --interval 30   # faster cadence
graft arborist --tend --profile work  # a specific profile
```

It runs against the active profile's pools. Stop it with Ctrl-C.

## What it watches

Five detectors, each reusing a probe graft already has rather than paralleling it. The
event JSON uses plain machine categories; the horticultural names are just how we talk
about them.

| Category (JSON) | Metaphor | What it flags | Reuses |
|---|---|---|---|
| `auth` | rot | GitHub App auth chain fails (key → JWT → installation → token) | the `arborist` chain |
| `runner` | blight | a graft-named runner registered but **offline** on GitHub (a missed deregistration) | `listRunners` |
| `capacity` | drought | configured count exceeds host capacity; a fleet worker is **paused** | `provider.capacity`, Orchard `report()` |
| `leaf` | wilt | a slot **wedged** in a transient phase (booting/provisioning/…) past a timeout | persisted slot phases |
| `supervisor` | deadwood | a graft VM the backend still has that **no slot owns** (a leak) | `provider.managedVMNames()` |

### Severity

| Severity | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `info` | a normal observation — e.g. the periodic heartbeat |
| `warn` | degraded, worth a look, not yet dropping work |
| `critical` | actively broken / will drop jobs |
| `recovered` | a previously-reported problem has cleared |

The monitor **edge-triggers**: it emits a problem when it first appears or its severity
changes, stays quiet while it persists unchanged, and emits a `recovered` when it clears.
A periodic `info` heartbeat (default every 300s) proves the monitor is alive even when
everything's healthy.

## Where findings go (sinks)

Every event fans out to all configured sinks at once. The generic ones are the trunk;
Slack / PagerDuty / Sentry are just reformatters in front of a webhook.

| Sink | Destination | Always on? |
|---|---|---|
| log | the normal `graft` stdout/stderr (human lines) | yes |
| JSONL | `~/.graft/logs/health.jsonl` — one event per line, append-only | yes |
| snapshot | `~/.graft/state/health.json` — the *current* set of active problems | yes |
| webhook | `POST <url>` per event, JSON body | when `monitor.webhooks` is set |

`health.jsonl` is your durable history (`tail -f` it, ship it anywhere line-oriented).
`health.json` is the pull surface for a GUI/dashboard — it holds only what's wrong *right
now* (a `warn`/`critical` upserts by key; a `recovered` clears it).

## Event schema

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-06-12T21:30:00Z",
  "severity": "warn",
  "category": "runner",
  "checkID": "offline-runner",
  "subject": "graft-9f2a…",
  "message": "graft runner registered but offline on org:acme — likely a missed deregistration",
  "detail": { "target": "org:acme", "runnerId": "42", "status": "offline" },
  "suggestedAction": "deregister it (`graft runners prune`) so the slot can replace it"
}
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `timestamp` | ISO-8601 (UTC) |
| `severity` | `info` \| `warn` \| `critical` \| `recovered` |
| `category` | `auth` \| `runner` \| `capacity` \| `leaf` \| `supervisor` |
| `checkID` | stable sub-id within a category (`offline-runner`, `wedged-slot`, `orphan-vm`, …) |
| `subject` | the pool / vm / runner / host it's about, or absent if global |
| `message` | human summary |
| `detail` | string→string context, varies by check |
| `suggestedAction` | a hint — **graft does not act on it yet** (the remediation seam reads it) |

`category` + `checkID` + `subject` together identify a *condition*, so a webhook receiver
can dedup and correlate a problem with its later `recovered`.

## Wiring an alert sink

A receiver is tiny — it gets the schema above and reformats. A complete relay to Slack:

```python
# health_relay.py — POST graft health events, forward problems to Slack
from http.server import BaseHTTPRequestHandler, HTTPServer
import json, urllib.request

SLACK = "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXX/YYY/ZZZ"

class H(BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_POST(self):
        e = json.loads(self.rfile.read(int(self.headers["Content-Length"])))
        if e["severity"] in ("warn", "critical", "recovered"):
            icon = {"warn":"⚠️","critical":"🔴","recovered":"✅"}[e["severity"]]
            text = f'{icon} *{e["category"]}/{e["checkID"]}* {e.get("subject","")}: {e["message"]}'
            urllib.request.urlopen(SLACK, json.dumps({"text": text}).encode())
        self.send_response(204); self.end_headers()

HTTPServer(("", 8099), H).serve_forever()
```

Then point graft at it:

```json
"monitor": { "webhooks": ["http://127.0.0.1:8099"] }
```

The same shape forwards to PagerDuty (Events API v2) or Sentry — only the reformat
differs. The webhook sink never blocks the monitor: a dead receiver degrades to a warning
in graft's own log, nothing more.

## Config

A `monitor` block is optional — absent, you get observe-only defaults (no webhooks). It
sits at the top level of a profile, alongside `provider`/`github`/`pools`:

```json
{
  "provider": { "type": "tart" },
  "github": { "appId": 12345, "target": "org:acme" },
  "pools": [ { "name": "macos", "image": "…", "os": "macos", "count": 2 } ],
  "monitor": {
    "intervalSeconds": 60,
    "webhooks": ["http://127.0.0.1:8099"],
    "heartbeatSeconds": 300,
    "slotStuckTimeoutSeconds": 300,
    "webhookMinSeverity": "warn"
  }
}
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `intervalSeconds` | 60 | seconds between sweeps (CLI `--interval` overrides) |
| `webhooks` | `[]` | URLs each event is POSTed to |
| `heartbeatSeconds` | 300 | min spacing of the `info` heartbeat; `0` disables |
| `slotStuckTimeoutSeconds` | 300 | a transient-phase slot older than this is flagged |
| `webhookMinSeverity` | `warn` | floor for webhook delivery (`recovered` always goes) |

## The self-healing seam

Remediation is the *next* layer, deliberately not built yet — you trust detection in the
wild first, then flip on healers one at a time. The seam is published:
[`Remediator`](../Sources/GraftCore/Remediator.swift) is a protocol that consumes the same
`HealthEvent` stream the sinks already carry, reads `suggestedAction`, and dispatches on
`category` + `checkID`. When it lands it will be opt-in (a future `--tend --heal`),
guarded by backoff + a circuit breaker so it absorbs failures instead of amplifying them —
never on by default.
